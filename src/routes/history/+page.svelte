	<h2>A Brief History</h2>

	<div>
		<p class="lead">
			Suffragism has a long and storied history in the state of Kansas. In the wake of the Wyandotte
			Constitutional Convention, which established Kansas as a free state in 1859, Kansas
			suffragists waged five campaigns to win women&#8216;s right to vote. After statehood in 1861,
			women could vote for local school boards. In 1867, Kansas was the first state in the nation to
			battle for full woman's suffrage. National suffragists campaigned across the state, but white
			male voters rejected two propositions to remove the words “white” and “male” from the
			Constitution.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Twenty years later, Kansas became the first state to grant municipal suffrage to women on
			February 15, 1887, Susan B. Anthony&#8216;s birthday. Despite a vigorous campaign in 1894,
			male voters rejected a woman suffrage amendment. Yet Kansas women won universal suffrage in
			1912, after Lizzie S. Sheldon wrote this resolution: “The right of citizens of the state of
			Kansas to vote and hold offices shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.” In 1919,
			Jane M. Brooks founded the first state chapter of the League of Women Voters, before the
			Nineteenth Amendment of the US Constitution granted voting rights to women in 1920.
