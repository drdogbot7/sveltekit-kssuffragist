	<h2>A Brief History</h2>

	<div>
		<p class="lead">
			The struggle for women&#8216;s suffrage in Kansas has a long and storied history. Beginning
			with the 1859 Wyandotte Constitutional Convention, Kansas suffragists waged five campaigns to
			win women&#8216;s right to vote. After statehood in 1861, women could vote for local school
			boards. In 1867, Kansas was the first state in the nation to battle for full woman's suffrage.
			National suffragists campaigned across the state, but white male voters rejected two
			propositions to remove the words “white” and “male” from the Constitution.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Twenty years later, Kansas became the first state to grant municipal suffrage to women on
			February 15, 1887, Susan B. Anthony&#8216;s birthday. Despite a vigorous campaign in 1894,
			male voters rejected a woman suffrage amendment. Yet Kansas women won universal suffrage in
			1912, after Lizzie S. Sheldon wrote this resolution: “The right of citizens of the state of
			Kansas to vote and hold offices shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.” In 1919,
			Jane L. Brooks founded the first state chapter of the League of Women Voters in Kansas, before
			the Nineteenth Amendment of the US Constitution granted voting rights to women in 1920.
