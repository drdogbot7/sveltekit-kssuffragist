    <p>
      Born in 1846. Nation was the most famous (or perhaps infamous) member of the Woman&#8216;s
      Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). She attacked saloons with a hatchet in Kiowa and Wichita.
      At times she used rocks, brickbats, and bottles. Nation even invaded the chambers of the
      governor of Kansas. Between 1900 and 1910, police arrested her 30 times for “hatchetations,”
      as she called them. She was married twice with one child, Charlien, who was committed to the
      Texas State Lunatic Asylum in 1905.

      Born 1872. Allender was a political cartoonist and suffragist. She served as the official
      cartoonist for Alice Paul&#8216;s National Woman&#8216;s Party. She was one of the key
      artists in the NWP&#8216;s publication, ‘The Suffragist.&#8216; Between 1914 and 1922,
      Allender created around 200 cartoons for ‘The Suffragist&#8216; and its successor journal,
      ‘Equal Rights.&#8216; She made countless images depicting women fighting for suffrage and
      better rights. She created the “Allender Girl,” an attractive, “New Girl”-type suffragist
      who became a mainstay in many of her illustrations. She also designed the “Jailed for
      Freedom” pin that was given to women who were jailed for campaigning and picketing for the
      cause. Essie (Franklin) Boutwell- only women in KS to get a jail pin- Topeka
