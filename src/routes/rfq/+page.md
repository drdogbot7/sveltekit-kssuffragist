**Kansas Suffragist Memorial  
PUBLIC ART REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ)  
DUE: ~~February 15th, 2023~~ April 1st, 2023**

## Collaborators

League Women Voters of Kansas, AAUW of KS, and Capitol Preservation Committee

## Description

The Kansas Suffragist Memorial Committee is seeking professional artists or artist teams to develop innovative, original art to be incorporated as part of the new display at the Kansas State Capitol building.
Background: We want to honor the role that Kansas women have played in the formation of our State. Statewide we have been celebrating the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, granting women suffrage. It is our goal to commemorate these Kansas women who had statewide and national impact or importance in achieving women’s right to vote. We have identified historic Kansas women from across the state to inspire artist’s creativity. It is our wish that this public art evoke inspiration about our Kansas past, educate people about important Kansas women, and be relevant, e.g., pass on our values to the next generation.

## Kansas Suffragist History

A short synopsis of the history of suffragism in Kansas and a list of 13 notable Kansas suffragists, identified by the Kansas Historical Society, are provided [here](/history). The biographies of these women are provided to inspire project ideas—it is not required that all 13 women be included in the final memorial.

## Eligibility

We prefer to select a Kansas artist but the opportunity to compete for this project is open to all professional artists, age 18 and over, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, military status, sexual orientation, marital status, sexual identity, or physical or mental disability. Interested local and regional artists are strongly encouraged to submit their qualifications.

## Project Parameters

There are two possible locations in the Kansas Capitol on the first floor of the building. The dimensions are approximate. The artist is responsible for confirming all measurements.

## Requirements

The memorial design must include all of the following characteristics:

- The finished memorial must be essentially maintenance free;
- The memorial cannot be permanently attached to the stone floor or any stone on the walls;
- The memorial can be attached on the plaster wall;
- The project must include text with brief historical information;
- The artwork should also speak for itself without the text;
- If the artwork is free standing, it requires a base heavy enough to withstand tugs or pulls;
- Cost for the project and installation should not exceed $125,000.

## Submissions

A full proposal can be submitted here, and includes:

1. A letter of interest, outlining your approach to public art and insights regarding your interest in making art for this project. Include what you bring to the project as an artist; challenges and/or sources of inspiration presented by the project; and what you hope to gain from this experience. (no more than 3 pages)
2. A brief professional resume/CV, including professional references and their contact information. (no more than 3 pages)
3. An annotated image list, including images of at least 5 and no more than 10 past
   works in a PDF format that clearly indicates the title, dimensions, materials, date of work, and locations.

## Selection Process

The selection panel will comprise arts professionals familiar with the field of public art and community members (members of the Suffragist Memorial committee). The panel will review proposals and select a small group of finalists. The finalists will be asked to submit a maquette (or scale model) and description of the proposed art, a budget, and timeline for completion of the art. The finalists will be given a small stipend to cover partial costs for the artist’s proposal.

**The criteria used by the panel will include:**

1. Does the artist present innovative and original ideas in an eloquent manner?
2. What kinds of professional public art experience does the artist have?
3. Does the artist reflect the diversity of women involved in suffrage?
4. Does the artist indicate an interest and the ability to contribute to a contemporary discussion of women’s education?
